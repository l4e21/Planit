## Planit: Live Expert Systems

Planit uses a snapshot system and the XPCE GUI builder to produce declarative Smalltalk-like systems so that you can build live, interactable expert systems.

To make Planit your own, you can call `snap:save(YourDir)` to produce a backup, and then you can start hacking as much as you want! Assert and retract dynamically, then again call `save` when you're done. You can alter the save predicate to add new modules.

Currently there is no versioning system, personally I use git, maybe there'll be one in the future.
